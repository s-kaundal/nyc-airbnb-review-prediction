# NYC Airbnb Reviews per Month Prediction

This academic project was to solve a supervised ML problem from scratch starting from a dataset. 

Steps taken to predict reviews per month given a certain Airbnb listing in New York City were to preprocess the dataset with feature engineering to produce more meaningful and accurate predictions, use different ML models to find the best predictor, finetune the selected model by hyperparameter optimization for more accuracy, and finding out feature importances and explaining predictions with SHAP plots with the finalized model.
